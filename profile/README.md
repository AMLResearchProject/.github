The [Peter Moss Acute Myeloid & Lymphoblastic AI Research Project](https://www.leukemiaairesearch.com/research/project/aml-all-ai-research-project) is an [Asociación de Investigacion en Inteligencia Artificial Para la Leucemia Peter Moss](https://www.leukemiaairesearch.com/) research project focusing on the use of Artificial Intelligence in the battle against Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).

The research project was founded in 2018 when Peter Moss was diagnosed with AML and given a few weeks to live. The research project was founded by Peter's eldest grandson, Adam Milton-Barker later joined by co-founders Prof. Ho Leung Ng and Dr Amita Kapoor. This research project was the foundations for what became Asociación de Investigacion en Inteligencia Artificial Para la Leucemia Peter Moss.

AML has no known warning signs, so early detection is very hard if not impossible. In Peter's case, the disease was completely missed in a standard blood test 1 month before being diagnosed terminal with AML. Adam was convinced that there must have been signs in that blood test, and possibly in earlier results, he set out to form a team of volunteers with the goals of using Artificial Intelligence for the early detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

**In loving memory of Peter Edward Moss, 5th Aug 1939 - 24th Aug 2019, who bravely battled Acute Myeloid Leukemia. A loving husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather.**
